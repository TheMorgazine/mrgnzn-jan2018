## Chapter One

Juliana looked up from her laptop when she felt the car slow to a stop. She could already see the sprawling headquarters for the region's Asset Tracking Center, as well as a blonde haired man wearing a uniform who was walking towards her vehicle.

The window on the left side of the car retracted automatically as soon as the guard was within three feet of the vehicle. Juliana scooted over to the left side of the car so that she could talk to him, a set of papers in her hands. "Hello, I'm Juliana Roberts," She began. “I have an appointment to speak with the Director of Operations, Cameron Wessels.”

The guard accepted her paperwork consisting of a letter from Cameron with the ATC's letterhead on it, as well as her Michigan State driver’s license.

"You're with the Lansing Chamber of Commerce?" He said after calling up a schedule on a tablet.

"Yes,"Juliana said. “It was a long drive, but gave me some time to catch up.”“You may proceed. Our mainframe will guide your vehicle to an available parking space with a charging station.” The guard lifted his arm, and waved at the gate. Immediately, it swung open. The engine on Juliana's car revved to life, and her car rolled through the opening in the gate while she collected her things and packed them back into her bag.

Juliana was only in the front lobby for a few minutes before a man she recognized from her files as Cameron approached her. "Ms. Roberts," he said, offering his hand. “Good to see you again.”

"Mr. Wessels, it's been a while." Juliana said.

Cameron motioned towards the security doors. "Let me give you a tour, and then we can talk in my office."

They walked past several offices before they reached Main Operations. The room was filled with three or four clusters of desks, each equipped with numerous monitors. Enormous display screens were mounted onto the walls. Every screen was filled with animated graphs, text, or maps filled with dots. It felt like a cross between the bridge of the starship *Enterprise* and Air Traffic Control.

"This is where we track every automatron in the state," Cameron said. “And intervene if something goes wrong.”

"What can go wrong?" Julianna asked.

"Mechanical or software failure. We also scan for viruses and hackers, although those types of issues are less common."

"And the androids that my dad sells?" Juliana asked.

"They are tracked here, but a separate unit handles robots. I'll show you."
